# CrunchCycles
A legacy (deprecated) LabVIEW script to help process methane isotopologue-abundance data from an Aerodyne TILDAS instrument.  I used it as part of my data reduction workflow for methane clumping prior to developing `CANSEXPRESS`.

**System** 
* LabVIEW 2013 (Student Version)
* The compiled version (`CrunchCycles_v1k.exe`) requires [LabVIEW Run-Time Engine](http://www.ni.com/download/labview-run-time-engine-2013/4059/en/)
